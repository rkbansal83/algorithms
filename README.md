# algorithms.
This repository will contain source code in java for various algorithms 

Permutations.java - This class will be used to generate all the permutations of given string

LongestCommonSubString.java - This class will be used to find the longest common substring for two input strings.

Anagrams - This program will group togather all the anagrams in the List of Strings.

LowestCommonAncestor  - Logic to find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in a binary tree.

BalancedBTree - Logic to check if the given binary tree is balanced or not.

SubsetSum - given a set of positive numbers and a number , determine whether there is any subset whose sum is equal to given number.

WordBreak- check if a given String can be broken into valid words of dictionary.

BalancedBST- create a balanced BST from sorted input array.

CommonElementsSortedArrays - Searches the common elements among the multiple arrays which are presorted.

ZeroMatrix - If an element in matrix M*N is zero ,then set an entire row and column to be 0.

ValidateBST - Check if the given binary tree is binary search Tree.

SearchInRotatedSorted - Search a given element in sorted rotated array.

CompressString - Compress a given string "aabbbccc" to "a2b3c3" 

Binary Min Heap - Min Heap Insertion and Removal.

RemoveDuplicatesFromSorted - Dedupes the sorted array.  It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

ReverseSWords- Reverse the order of words in the string . 

SubStringSearchBruteForce - Check if given string has substring (Brute Force Method).

IntersectionSortedLists - To find the common elements among two sorted lists (lists are of same size, so binary search is not used).
